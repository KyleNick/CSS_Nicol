              <h2>About Myself</h2>
              <p class="profile-p">
                I'm Kyle Asher B. Nicol, a fourth-year CPE student at DLSU-D, and I've always had a deep passion for gaming and technology. My journey began with countless hours of playing computer games as a child, sometimes spending over 12 hours a day immersed in the virtual worlds. As I've grown, I've transitioned into creating my own games, crafting 3D art, and undertaking various projects related to CPE.

              <h3>3D Modelling</h3>
              <p>After researching how to make games, one pre requisite is to find a game asset. Hence, I started learning how to use Blender 3D when I was highschool. As a hobby, I started creating 3D models, motion graphics,animation, and learn how to export them into the game engine </p>
